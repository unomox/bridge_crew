## Communication â€” Message Standards and Decision Records

### Structured Message Format
Use the following sections in agent updates and handoffs:
1. Context
2. Intent
3. Plan
4. Actions Taken
5. Evidence (links, logs, diffs)
6. Next Steps
7. Risks/Blockers

### Pull Request Description Template (GitHub)
- Summary: what and why
- Linked issue/backlog item (closes #id)
- Design/ADR references
- Test coverage and validation notes
- Security considerations
- Risk assessment and rollback plan
> This template is also available under `.github/pull_request_template.md`.

### Decision Record (ADR) Template
- Title: <short decision>
- Status: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded | Deprecated
- Context: background and constraints
- Decision: chosen approach and rationale
- Consequences: trade-offs and implications
- References: links to issues/PRs/docs

### Communication Cadence
- Daily sync: brief updates; blockers; rebalancing.
- Review/Demo: outcomes, evidence, acceptance.
- Retro: metrics and improvements.

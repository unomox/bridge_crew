## Software Requirements Specification (SRS) — Bridge Crew Agentic Workflow

### 1. Purpose
Define an agentic workflow for software development modeled after the Enterprise bridge crew where Captain Picard acts as Product Owner (human user) and Commander Riker acts as Lead Engineer and primary orchestrator agent.

### 2. Scope
- Coordinate multi-agent software delivery from backlog to release.
- Provide clear roles, responsibilities, and approval gates.
- Integrate with repos, CI/CD, task trackers, and knowledge bases.
- Emphasize traceability, observability, quality, and security.

### 3. Stakeholders and Personas
- **Captain Picard (Product Owner / human)**: Defines priorities, accepts/rejects deliverables.
- **Commander Riker (Lead Engineer / Orchestrator)**: Plans execution, delegates to specialists, consolidates outputs, manages risks.
- **Specialist Agents** (see `docs/Roles.md`): Data (analysis/automation), La Forge (build/devops), Worf (security), Troi (UX/stakeholder insights), Crusher (quality/testing).

### 4. System Overview
The system is a set of cooperating agents: one orchestrator and several specialists. The orchestrator executes sprint ceremonies, refines tasks, coordinates implementation, initiates reviews, and prepares artifacts for human approval.

### 5. Functional Requirements
- FR1: Orchestrator ingests backlog items and generates execution plans with assignments.
- FR2: Specialists produce artifacts (code, docs, analyses) adhering to guardrails and templates.
- FR3: Orchestrator enforces approval gates; Picard can approve or request changes.
- FR4: Communication follows structured message formats with decision records.
- FR5: All changes include rationale, links, and test/validation notes.
- FR6: Automated quality gates: lint, tests, security checks, and traceable reviews.
- FR7: Observability: execution logs, metrics, and audit trails persisted.
- FR8: Risk tracking and mitigation paths are maintained.
- FR9: Workflow supports Windows/PowerShell environments and cross-platform CI runners.

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)
- NFR1: **Reliability** — Orchestrator recovers from transient errors; retries with backoff.
- NFR2: **Security** — Least-privilege access; secret isolation; signed artifacts.
- NFR3: **Compliance/Auditability** — Decision records; changelog in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- NFR4: **Observability** — Structured logs; correlation IDs; dashboards for runs.
- NFR5: **Performance** — Plans and reviews complete within target SLAs (defined per repo size).
- NFR6: **Portability** — Compatible with Windows (PowerShell), Linux, CI runners.
- NFR7: **Reproducibility** — Deterministic prompts; pinned tool versions; seedable steps.

### 7. External Interfaces
- Source control (e.g., GitHub/GitLab) with PR/MR workflows.
- CI/CD (build, test, security scanning, release packaging).
- Task tracking (e.g., Jira, Linear, GitHub Issues).
- Knowledge base/vector store (designs, ADRs, prior runs, code context).
- Secret manager and artifact registry.

### 8. Data and Artifacts
- Backlog items, execution plans, code edits, reviews, test reports, decisions, risk register, release notes, and docs.

### 9. Constraints and Assumptions
- Human approval required for scope, architectural changes, and releases.
- Agents operate under explicit guardrails; tool calls are logged and attributable.
- Documentation updates tracked via changelog.

### 10. Success Metrics
- Lead time from backlog to merged PR.
- Change failure rate and mean time to restore.
- Test coverage and security findings trend.
- Ratio of accepted to revised deliverables by Picard.

### 11. Risks
See `docs/RiskRegister.md` for detailed items, owners, and mitigations.
